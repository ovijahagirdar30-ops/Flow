## Motivation

I wanted to build a fully-featured Android app completely **free**, **ad-free**, and **privacy-focused** — no servers, no tracking, no data collection, works 100% offline.
This project was mainly a way for me to learn modern **Kotlin** (coming from a Java-only background) while creating something truly **customizable** that I (and others) can easily modify, extend and adapt to different needs.

## Architecture

FlowState follows **Clean Architecture** with a clear separation of concerns:

UI Layer (Presentation)
├── ViewModels
├── Composable Screens
└── UI State Management

Domain Layer (Business Logic)
├── Use Cases (Interactors)
├── Repository Interfaces
└── Domain Models (Task, SubTask, Priority)

Data Layer (Infrastructure)
├── Repository Implementations
├── Local Data Source (Room)
└── Data Models (Entities)
```
